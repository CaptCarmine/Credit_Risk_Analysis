# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose

A lending service is looking to utilize machine learning to determine credit risk. 6 different models will be used to create a loan identification process and will be looking at the confusion matrix to determine user accuracy rates.

## Results

See below for the Results of the 6 Different Machine learning Models, I have them ranked from most accurate up top to least accurate.

## Summary

Based on the results for the 6 models it is clear that the Ensemble classifier had the best performance, and is what I would recommend. It still has a high number of false positives, leading to a low precision. That precision is something, even though I recommend this model, is something to be aware of.
